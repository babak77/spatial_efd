A python package to facilitate EFD analysis on shapefile data, built upon the pyefd module.

This package handles basic shapefile input using pyshp and deals with all of the issues of normalizing spatial data to work with the EFD technique.


$project will solve your problem of where to start with documentation,
by providing a basic explanation of how to do it easily.

Look how easy it is to use:

    import project
    # Get your stuff done
    project.do_stuff()
